## The Problem
Utsav is an annual sports festival of Dev Sanskriti Vishwavidyalaya, Haridwar. In
today’s world, where everything is online or in the process of moving to the online
platforms, Utsav is still managed by the file system. There are some other problems
too, in this system, which we face during the period of Utsav, which are:
- The registration process is manual and there was not even a register for
Utsav 2020. We had to write our names and desired sports on a piece of
paper and submit it in the sports department.
- There’s no fixed schedule for individual sports for the league matches. And
there is not any notice board to display such schedules. The only way for
communication was the hostel announcements before an hour of the
commencement of particular events.
- We missed some events due to the above factor, as we were in classroom/lab
and we had not any prior information for the same.
- The records for the past year matches are not available for us. These records
may help teams or individual players for planning their strategies.
- Apart from closing ceremony (Where winners of only major events are
announced), there is not any public display of the festival report.

## The Solution

# UTSAV

“UTSAV” is an online platform for the annual sports festival - Utsav of Dev
Sanskriti Vishwavidyalaya, Haridwar. It will be developed by the students of DSVV,
guided by teacher’s of DSVV, for the students and faculty members of DSVV. The
officials of DSVV can update information about Utsav and it’s schedule as well as
other sports events.
The purpose of the project titled “UTSAV” is to exclusively provide a web application
which is user friendly, reliable, free of cost for the University students to use.
In Addition this will provide users/university students with the ease of visiting the web
portal to register themselves or their teams, see past records and upcoming events.
There will be two types of users (apart from the administrator), first is students or
other such users, and second is the sports officials.
